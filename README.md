This is a mod of "Simple 360 Nand Flasher" by Swizzy

this mod's goals are to add an option to pick where to read or wtire the nand files from\to
"# Modded360NandFlaher" 

https://github.com/552eden/Modded360NandFlaher/releases/tag/pre-release 

this is the XEX for the modded simple360nandflasher im working on if anyone wants to check it out. instead of only working in its own folder, you can now choose where to dup the nand to or read the nand from

Current limitations: folder can be either root of a drive, or one folder deep

if you select a folder that dosent exist, app wil crash! (for now, im working on a fix)

feedback would be appreciated (as well as pull requests)
